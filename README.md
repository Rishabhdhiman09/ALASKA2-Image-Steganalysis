# ALASKA2-Image-Steganalysis

That file you downloaded may contain hidden messages that aren’t part of its regular contents. The same technology employed for digital watermarking is also misused by crime rings. Law enforcement must now use steganalysis to detect these messages as part of their investigations. Machine learning is an important tool in the discovery of this secret data.



Current methods produce unreliable results, raising false alarms. One reason for inaccuracy is the many different devices and processing combinations. Yet, detection models are trained on a homogeneous dataset. To increase accuracy, researchers must put data hidden within digital images “into the wild” (hence the name ALASKA) to mimic real world conditions.

We’ll create an efficient and reliable method to detect secret data hidden within innocuous-seeming digital images. Rather than limiting the data source, these images have been acquired with as many as 50 different cameras (from smartphone to full-format high end) and processed in different fashions.
